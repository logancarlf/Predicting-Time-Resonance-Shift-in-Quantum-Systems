# Predicting-Time-Resonance-Shift-in-Quantum-Systems
Performing accurate experiments with quantum systems requires precise knowledge of properties such as resonance frequencies. Since those properties change in an uncontrolled way due to fluctuations in external conditions (e.g. a magnetic field), one has to measure their values frequently. This is a large effort, and it implies interruption of the actual experiment. Goal of the project is to investigate the use of Bayesian inference. Rather than determining quantities with complete data-sets (that are costly to take), Bayesian inference would permit to take into account data taken in the past and to update the estimate of a resonance frequency by taking only little data. Goal of the project would be to develop a data-efficient approach that permits to follow the value of drifting system properties.
